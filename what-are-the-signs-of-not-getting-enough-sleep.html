                                            <p>A healthy home is a place that is safe for children. It is free from poisonous substances like lead which is commonly found on paint. It should also be pest-free. The air quality should also be safe. Surfaces and poorly-lit areas have to be free from molds and mildew to avoid asthma attacks. When building and managing a home, the owner should consider the safety hazards to avoid accidents and even fatalities.</p>
